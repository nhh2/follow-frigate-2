        <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
          <h5>Where:</h5>
            <p>Chicago! Living in the Windy City is great, except when it's windy. Thereâ€™s no shortage of things to do, friends to see, and areas to explore. My wife and I enjoy checking out new restaurants and going for long walks when the weather allows.</p>
          <h5>What:</h5>
            <p>I'm a full-time MBA student. Returning to life as a student was an adjustment after several years in finance. Having more time to fully explore my interests and passions is something I try not to take for granted. An example? Creating this blog!</p> 
          <h5>Next:</h5>
            <p>Not sure!</p>
